### 🥉 Bronze Layer
This layer serves as the raw data landing zone. It stores data *as-is* from the source systems, with ingestion primarily from CSV Files into a SQL Server Database.

### 🥈 Silver Layer
The **Silver Layer** is where data transformation begins. It includes crucial processes like data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to prepare the data for more refined analysis.

### 🥇 Gold Layer
The **Gold Layer** represents the business-ready data. Here, data is meticulously modeled into a **star schema**, optimized specifically for efficient reporting and advanced analytical queries.

## 🎯 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate diverse sales data, thereby enabling robust analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
* **Data Sources**: Seamlessly import data from two distinct source systems (ERP and CRM), provided as convenient CSV files.
* **Data Quality**: Implement rigorous processes to cleanse and proactively resolve any data quality issues *before* analysis.
* **Integration**: Effectively combine both source datasets into a single, cohesive, and user-friendly data model specifically designed for analytical queries.
* **Scope**: The project's focus is exclusively on the *latest* dataset; historization of data is not a required component at this stage.
* **Documentation**: Provide clear, concise, and comprehensive documentation of the final data model to effectively support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
